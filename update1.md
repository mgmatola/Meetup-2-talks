# Detroit JS 2, 3, and beyond!

![DetroitJS Logo](detroit-js-logo.png)

Hello fellow JavaScripters!

Our group has grown tremendously quickly in size. We stand at 215 members! As the language and community grows, we'll just keep getting bigger and bigger, like a blob until we completely subsume the city and all of it's members.

[The 2nd Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Detroit-Javascript/events/230839564/) is set for Thursday, June 30th 7PM at [Ambassador](http://www.getambassador.com/) in Royal Oak. Seating is limited, so if you have RSVP'd "yes", and cannot make it, please change your status to "no" so that someone else can attend. We have a waiting list of about 20 people who need more JavaScript in their lives. [Control-Tec](http://www.control-tec.com/) is sponsoring the food for the evening. I created [a poll to see what kind of food you're willing to put in your mouth](http://www.meetup.com/Detroit-Javascript/polls/1226387/). If you have a better food suggestion, message me and I will add it to the poll.

I just announced the [3rd JavaScript meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Detroit-Javascript/events/231777906/). RSVP will be open the day after meetup 2. This time in Detroit at [Grand Circus Co](http://www.grandcircus.co/). This meetup only has seating for 30 people. I deeply appreciate all of sponsors for being super kind, and completely rad with their resources.

For Meetup 4 I'd like to take us into a different direction, and I need your help to make it come possible. I'd like to find a location where we can regularly hold the meetups and create a more engaging atmosphere. We're looking for a location in Detroit. A bar, pub, or restaurant that has a separate room and seating for 50-100. The ideal place will also have:

- Wifi
- A screen and projector, or large tv
- Will charge us little or no money for using their space
- Serve drinks
- Serve food

If you have any leads or suggestions, please contact me steve@stevebarman.com or message me via Meetup. If this doesn't work out, I have a fallback space for meetup 4 that seats 100.
