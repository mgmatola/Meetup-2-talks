- __A gentle introduction to currying in JavaScript__
  - led by: Michael Matola
  - abstract: I struggled through many explanations and examples of currying/partial function application before finally starting to understand it. I offer a gentle introduction to the hows and whys of  currying in JavaScript (with added bonus: closures).
